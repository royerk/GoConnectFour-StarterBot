# GoConnectFour-StarterBot
Golang starter bot for [TheAiGames.com](TheAiGames.com) connect-four AI challenge.

As a new platform (riddles.io) has been created to support future AI competitions no improvements (apart from critical fix) will come to the current platform. This implies that Go support won't be extended. Right now the platform only accepts bots that presents all their files in the same folder. Better Go management is on the todo list for the next platform ([source: forum](http://theaigames.com/discussions/general/55b62e105d203cbb328b4574/go-bot-compile-process/1/show)).

This is a single file go bot that plays randomly for players, like me, who want to mess around with Go on a nice & simple project.

Cheers
